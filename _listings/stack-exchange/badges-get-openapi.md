  title: Stack Exchange Get Badges
  description: "Returns all the badges in the system.\n \nBadge sorts are a tad complicated.
    For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater
    than named.\n \nThis means that you can get a list of all tag based badges by
    passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named,
    with sort=type.\n \nFor ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater
    than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver
    for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.\n \nrank is the default sort.\n
    \nThis method returns a list of badges."
