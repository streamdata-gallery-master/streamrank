  title: Stack Exchange Get Comments
  description: "Gets all the comments on the site.\n \nIf you're filtering for interesting
    comments (by score, creation date, etc.) make use of the sort paramter with appropriate
    min and max values.\n \nIf you're looking to query conversations between users,
    instead use the /users/{ids}/mentioned and /users/{ids}/comments/{toid} methods.\n
    \nThe sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment
    object:\n - creation - creation_date\n - votes - score\n  creation is the default
    sort.\n \n It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min,
    max, fromdate, and todate.\n \nThis method returns a list of comments."

      description: "Returns all the badges in the system.\n \nBadge sorts are a tad
        complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered
        to be greater than named.\n \nThis means that you can get a list of all tag
        based badges by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges
        by passing max=named, with sort=type.\n \nFor ranks, bronze is greater than
        silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for
        just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for
        just bronze.\n \nrank is the default sort.\n \nThis method returns a list
