    "description": "Returns all the badges in the system.\n \nBadge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.\n \nThis means that you can get a list of all tag based badges by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named, with sort=type.\n \nFor ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.\n \nrank is the default sort.\n \nThis method returns a list of badges.",
