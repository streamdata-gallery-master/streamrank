  title: Uber
  description: Using the Uber API, developers can integrate the power of Uber into
    3rd party applications. Calls to the API can be made to request information on
    available car types, driver location expressed in geo-coordinates, time estimates,
    estimated prices (including currency conversion when applicable), as well as user
    account history and activity. The Uber API documentation describes deep linking
    techniques to programmatically launch the native app from iOS or Android, or the
    Uber mobile site from mobile web. The API comes with a detailed style guide and
    asset package for implementing licensed brandings. The Uber API Affiliate program
    grants cash and issues Uber credits for new user onboarding through a 3rd party
    app.
